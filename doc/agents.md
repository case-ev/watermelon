## Agents and states
An agent is modelled by the `Agent` class, which contains:
- An identifier that, like with vertices, **must** be unique as the program associates a singleton to a specific identifier.
- The graph that the agent belongs to. Currently, the program doesn't use this information anywhere but, in the future, this might change so it is recommended to specify it anyways.
- A group of the decisions that the agent makes in the graph. These decisions are contained in the `Decision` data structure, which is essentially a tuple of vertices and actions intended to represent taking an action at a specific vertex.
- A state variable which represents the state of said agent at that moment. This is modelled by the `AgentState` data structure.
- A battery capacity in Wh, which indicates how much energy the battery holds.
- A material capacity in kg, which indicates how heavy of a payload the agent can carry.
