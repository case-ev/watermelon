watermelon_tests
================
Testing suite for watermelon. This contains two types of tests:
 - In *watermelon* there are unittests. The directory structure reflects
   the structure of the actual project, so you know which file corresponds
   to what functionality.
 - In *integration* you will find integration tests, which take all the
   functionality in watermelon, puts it together, and verifies that it
   works correctly.
